We need to sort out what happens if one of us loses his/her job or dies.

We agree that Alexis will pay $1000 and Marcus $1500 per month to the
mortgage. We will both pay $500 per month to the joint account to be used
for house expenses, or more as needed, but only if mutually agreeable,
and in that situation, we will both contribute the same amount
to the joint account.

We agree to keep a detailed ledger recording all money each of
us spent on the house, including closing costs, mortgage payments,
repairs, and renovations.  In this way we will always know
what proportion of the total worth of the home we own,
and what proportion thereof each of us owns individually.

Maybe we need some penalty if someone stops paying their share of the 
mortgage? Like, we lose that amount in the equity we already accrued 
for every mortgage payment missed?

No out-of-town guest will stay in the house for more than ten days
at a time without the consent of the both Alexis and Marcus
and not to exceed 30 nights per year...

Local guests will not spend the night more than two nights per week.

Something about parties? How many/max size?

No one can sell their share of the house for at least 5 years? Unless 
some dire circumstances occur, of course (med emergency, death in 
fam, loss of job?) If someone wants to be bought out after that, we 
use the equity ratios above and have the house appraised. If you want 
to be bought out, for example, and have a 40% share of the equity, 
then I pay you either 40% of the appraised value or 40% of how much 
we've put into the house, whichever is less.
