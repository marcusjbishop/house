\section{To be included in the contract}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Alexis will pay \$1000 and Marcus \$1500 per 
month towards the mortgage, to be paid in two installments every month. 
Marcus will transfer his share to our joint account on 
the 31st and the 14th of every month. Alexis will submit the payments from our joint account 
on the first and the fifteenth of every month. 

\item We will both pay \$500 per month to our joint account for house 
expenses. We will contribute more/less to the joint account as needed, but 
only if mutually agreeable, and in equal proportions.

\item\label{ledger} We agree to keep a detailed ledger recording all 
the money each of us has spent on the house, including closing costs, 
mortgage payments, repairs, and renovations, but not including 
furniture or decoration. It is this ledger which will determine and track each of our equity percentage at any time. 
This ledger will be kept up to date in the master branch of our shared git-hub repository located at https://github.com/marcusjbishop/house.


\item If one of us fails to make a mortgage payment, the other will 
make full payments, until two months have passed, recording the full 
payments in the ledger \autoref{ledger}
as payments made solely by him or her.
However, after two months have passed,
the delinquent owner will record {\em negative} 50\% 
of his or her usual payment in the ledger, while the paying owner
will continue to record his or her full payment.

\item Neither owner will sell his or her share of the house in the 
first five years of ownership, except in cases of medical emergency, 
death of a family member, or loss of job. After five years either 
owner can sell his or her share of the house, but only
to the other owner. The house will be appraised at the time of sale. Purchase price will be determined as follows:
Let $E$ be the percent equity we own in the house (vs. the bank) at the time of sale.
Let $P_s$ be the percent equity that the seller has at the time of sale (determined by our internal ledger \autoref{ledger}).
Let $A$ be the appraised value of the house at the time of sale.
Then, the buyer will pay the seller $E*P_s * A$ for their share of the house. Any resulting transfer taxes/fees will be equally split between Alexis and Marcus.
 



\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Not necessarily included in the contract}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Alexis makes all decoration decisions.

\item No out-of-town guest of one owner will stay in the house for 
more than ten consecutive days without the consent of the 
other owner.

\item The total number of nights any owner's out-of-town guests stay 
in the house will not exceed 30~nights per year.

\item Local guests will not spend the night more than two nights per 
week.

\item All house parties will be organized with the consent of both 
owners.
