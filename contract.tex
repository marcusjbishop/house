\section{To be included in the contract}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Alexis will pay \$1000 and Marcus \$1500 per 
month towards the mortgage, to be paid every four weeks for a total of 13 payments per year. 
Alexis and Marcus will both transfer the above amounts into their shared account every four weeks, 
and Alexis will submit the payments from our joint Tower Federal Union checking account (number 337921-02).

\item\label{budget} Alexis and Marcus will both pay \$500 per month to their joint account for house 
expenses, henceforth known as the "house budget". They will contribute more to the joint account as needed, but 
only if mutually agreeable, and in equal proportions. This shared "house budget" can only be used to pay for utilities and required repairs and maintenance.

\item\label{ledger} All house investments coming from sources other than the shared house budget shall be recorded in a detailed, digital ledger publicly available at
https://github.com/marcusjbishop/house
Expenses that can be included in the ledger include closing costs, mortgage payments, and renovation payments, but do not include investments in movable furniture, fixtures, or equipment (FF&E) that have no permanent connection to the structure of the house or utilities.
The ledger file details all investments made in the house by Alexis or Marcus beyond those covered by the shared house budget \autoref{budget}, shows 
the current percent equity each of them has in the house at a given time, and the current cost to buy either party out of their share of the house based upon the current appraised value.

The most recent ledger version that is valid is that which has a git tag signed by both Alexis and Marcus using PGP digital signatures.
When updates to the ledger are made and signed by one party, the other party has 72 hours to either agree to and sign the update, or to provide in writing their reason for not agreeing with the current ledger. If neither of these steps are taken with the aforementioned 72 hours, the delinquent signer's stake in the house decreases by ......


\item If one of us fails to make a mortgage payments, the other will 
make full payments, recording the full 
payments in the ledger \autoref{ledger}
as payments made solely by him or her.
However, the delinquent owner will record {\em negative} 50\% 
of his or her usual payment in the ledger, while the paying owner
will continue to record his or her full payment. After six months of continuous non-payment, the delinquent owner loses his/her entire stake in the house, and the other owner becomes the sole owner of the property.

\item Neither owner will request to be bought out of his or her share of the house in the 
first three years of ownership, except in cases of medical emergency, 
death of a family member, or loss of job. After three years either 
owner can sell his or her share of the house, but only
to the other owner. The house will be appraised and the 
buyer will pay the seller the buyout cost detailed in the recent ledger. The buying owner must buy out the selling owner within one year.
